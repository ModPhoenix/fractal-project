Fractal has applications for individuals, professionals, businesses, recruiters, and academic institutions. Join us in building the future of knowledge management and skills assessment!

## WIP Cypher schema representation

```
[Fractal]
   |
   |-- HAS_CHILD --> [Fractal]
   |
   |-- PROVIDES_CONTEXT_FOR --> [Fractal]
   |
   |-- HAS_KNOWLEDGE --> [Knowledge]
                             |
                             |-- IN_CONTEXT --> [Fractal]
```

Example schema in Cypher:

```cypher
// Define constraints
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (f:Fractal) ASSERT f.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (f:Fractal) ASSERT f.name IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (k:Knowledge) ASSERT k.id IS UNIQUE;

// Define indexes
CREATE INDEX ON :Fractal(name);
CREATE INDEX ON :Knowledge(id);

// Nodes
(:Fractal {
  id: UUID,
  name: String,
  createdAt: DateTime,
  updatedAt: DateTime
})

(:Knowledge {
  id: UUID,
  content: String
})

// Relationship structure:
(:Fractal)-[:HAS_CHILD]->(:Fractal)
(:Fractal)-[:PROVIDES_CONTEXT_FOR]->(:Fractal)
(:Fractal)-[:HAS_KNOWLEDGE]->(:Knowledge)
(:Knowledge)-[:IN_CONTEXT]->(:Fractal)
```

## Project Status

Fractal is currently in the research and development phase, focusing on creating a proof of concept:

- Exploring and refining the core concepts of the context-based interconnected knowledge graph
- Developing initial prototypes for key features
- Investigating optimal technical solutions for scalability and performance
- Conducting user research to validate assumptions and gather feedback

We are not yet at a stage for public release or wide-scale testing. However, we're excited about the potential of Fractal and are working diligently to bring this innovative platform to life.

Creating a context-based interconnected digital repository of knowledge is an ambitious and impactful project. To effectively develop such a system, consider the following steps and best practices:

1. 🎯 **Define Clear Objectives and Scope**

   - **Specify Use Cases**: Clearly outline the primary use cases your platform will serve, such as educational content sharing, skill assessment, or historical event mapping.
   - **Identify Target Users**: Determine who will benefit most from your platform—students, professionals, organizations, or educational institutions.

2. **Design a Robust Data Model**

   - **Utilize Graph Databases**: Since your project relies on interconnected data, a graph database like Neo4j is suitable. Your current Cypher schema is a good starting point.
   - **Refine Entity Relationships**: Ensure that relationships like `HAS_CHILD`, `PROVIDES_CONTEXT_FOR`, and `HAS_KNOWLEDGE` accurately represent the connections between knowledge units.
   - **Implement Ontologies**: Consider using or developing an ontology to standardize the types of knowledge and relationships.

3. **Develop a Scalable Architecture**

   - **Modular Design**: Break down the system into modular components (e.g., data storage, API layer, front-end interface) to enhance maintainability.
   - **Microservices**: Implement microservices for different functionalities to improve scalability and allow independent development and deployment.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Plan for indexing strategies and caching mechanisms to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

4. **Build an Intuitive User Interface**

   - **Visualizations**: Create interactive graphs and knowledge trees that allow users to explore connections seamlessly.
   - **User Experience (UX)**: Focus on a user-friendly design that caters to both novice and experienced users.
   - **Accessibility**: Ensure the platform is accessible to users with disabilities by following WCAG guidelines.

5. **Implement Context Management**

   - **Contextual Linking**: Develop algorithms that accurately associate knowledge pieces within relevant contexts.
   - **Dynamic Contexts**: Allow contexts to evolve over time as new information is added or as users interact with the system.
   - **Personalization**: Use machine learning to tailor content and suggestions based on individual user behavior and interests.

6. **Incorporate Collaboration and Validation Features**

   - **Peer Review System**: Enable users to validate each other's expertise and contributions to ensure content quality.
   - **Version Control**: Implement a system to track changes and updates to knowledge entries, similar to wiki platforms.
   - **Community Engagement**: Foster a community where users can discuss topics, provide feedback, and contribute collaboratively.

7. **Ensure Data Integrity and Security**

   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement robust user authentication and role-based access control to protect sensitive information.
   - **Data Encryption**: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit to safeguard against unauthorized access.
   - **Backup and Recovery**: Establish regular data backup procedures and disaster recovery plans.

8. **Leverage Existing Technologies and Standards**

   - **Semantic Web Technologies**: Utilize RDF, OWL, or SPARQL to enhance data interoperability and semantic richness.
   - **API Integration**: Provide RESTful or GraphQL APIs to allow external applications to interact with your platform.
   - **Open Source Tools**: Consider integrating with or adopting open-source projects that align with your goals to accelerate development.

9. **Plan for Scalability and Future Expansion**

   - **Cloud Infrastructure**: Use scalable cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) to handle varying loads and growth.
   - **Modular Scalability**: Design your system so that additional features or modules can be added without significant restructuring.
   - **Internationalization**: Prepare for multilingual support and localization to reach a global audience.

10. **Conduct Thorough Testing and Iteration**

    - **User Testing**: Regularly test prototypes with real users to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.
    - **Performance Testing**: Assess system performance under different scenarios to optimize responsiveness and reliability.
    - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement CI/CD pipelines to streamline development and deployment processes.

11. **Engage with the Community**

    - **Open Development**: Consider open-sourcing parts of your project to encourage community contributions.
    - **Partnerships**: Collaborate with educational institutions, organizations, or other platforms to enrich your knowledge base.
    - **Feedback Channels**: Create forums, surveys, or feedback tools to understand user needs and preferences better.

12. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**
    - **Data Privacy Compliance**: Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR or CCPA if applicable.
    - **Content Licensing**: Clearly define content ownership and licensing terms, especially if users can upload their own content.
    - **Ethical AI Use**: If implementing AI features, ensure they are free from bias and respect user privacy.

**Next Steps:**

- **Prototype Development**: Start building a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on core functionalities like knowledge mapping and visualization.
- **User Research**: Conduct surveys and interviews with potential users to validate your concepts and refine features.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Use an agile development approach to continuously integrate feedback and improve the platform.

**Resources:**

- **Graph Databases**: Explore Neo4j's features and community resources for best practices in graph data modeling.
- **Semantic Web**: Look into W3C standards for semantic web technologies to enhance interoperability.
- **UI/UX Design**: Utilize design thinking methodologies to create user-centered interfaces.

By approaching the project methodically and keeping the end-users' needs at the forefront, you'll increase the chances of building a successful and impactful platform. Good luck with your development journey!
